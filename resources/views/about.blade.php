                <h3>Backend Developer</h3>
                <p>
                    Hi! nice to meet you, I'm Filippo. I'm a passionate backend developer and I'm just starting my journey in the programming world. I specialize in Laravel development and I enjoy creating robust and scalable web applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My approach to coding is inspired by Japanese principles of simplicity, precision, and continuous improvement (改善 - Kaizen).
                    I believe in writing clean, maintainable code that solves real-world problems efficiently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, reading technical blogs, or contributing to open-source projects.
                </p>

                            As I progressed, I became interested in backend development and started learning PHP and MySQL. This led me to discover Laravel, which became my framework of choice.

                            I also value <strong>"Monozukuri"</strong> (ものづくり) - the art of making things with excellence, 
                            precision, and pride in craftsmanship. This guides my approach to coding and problem-solving.

                            Learning to code is a journey with many challenges, but with persistence, 
                            any obstacle can be overcome.
